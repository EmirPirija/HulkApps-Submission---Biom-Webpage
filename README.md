1. Tech Stack Used:

React (version 18.2.0)
HTML
CSS (Sass version 1.68.0)
JavaScript
Netlify for hosting

2. Approach to the Project:
I approached this project with a focus on simplicity and user experience, utilizing React (version 18.2.0) as the primary technology for building the webpage. I wanted to create a clean, responsive, and visually appealing webpage that effectively conveys the content and purpose. In addition to React, I used basic HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling, and various JavaScript libraries and dependencies to enhance the functionality.

Dependencies Used:

@testing-library/jest-dom: Version 5.17.0
@testing-library/react: Version 13.4.0
@testing-library/user-event: Version 13.5.0
antd: Version 5.9.4
bootstrap: Version 5.3.2
react-bootstrap: Version 2.9.0
react-bootstrap-carousel: Version 4.1.1
react-dom: Version 18.2.0
react-responsive: Version 9.0.2
react-scripts: Version 5.0.1
react-scroll: Version 1.8.9
sass: Version 1.68.0


What I Liked:
I thoroughly enjoyed the creative aspects of the project, particularly in terms of designing the layout and implementing the design. I made a conscious effort to rely more on React and its related dependencies, including React hooks, to craft dynamic and interactive components. The project was intentionally planned to minimize the use of Bootstrap and maximize the use of React's capabilities as it was instrumental in streamlining the development process, enhancing the project's functionality, and contributing to a seamless user experience. Additionally, I utilized plain CSS for styling, ensuring a polished and visually appealing presentation of the webpage.

What I Didnâ€™t Like:
During the development process, I encountered some tiny bugs with cross-browser compatibility, but nothing too scary. But, nevertheless, in the future, I would allocate additional time for thorough testing and debugging.

Issues Faced:
Cross-browser compatibility


3. Estimated Time to Complete the Test:
The estimated time to complete this project was 5 days with approximately 4 hours each day and that was mainly dealing with the positioning of each and every image and text. This includes planning, design, coding, debugging, testing, and deployment.

4. Known Issues:

Instagram Button Disappearing on MacOS: There is a known issue where the Instagram button may disappear when hovering on MacOS.
Limited Responsiveness: Currently, the webpage is not fully responsive and supports a minimum resolution of 1440x900. However, please note that improving responsiveness is on my development roadmap, and I intend to make the necessary adjustments to enhance the user experience on a variety of devices and screen sizes. I am ready to address this issue upon request if needed.
