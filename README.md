#Webpage hosted by Netlify; https://web-biom.netlify.app/ and is now live ready for review and critics.

1. Tech Stack Used:

-React (version 18.2.0)
-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript
-Netlify for hosting (link: https://web-biom.netlify.app/)

2. Approach to the Project:
I approached this project with a focus on simplicity and user experience, utilizing React as the primary technology for building the webpage. I wanted to create a clean, responsive, and visually appealing webpage that effectively conveys the content and purpose. In addition to React, I used HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling, and various JavaScript libraries and dependencies to enhance the functionality.

Dependencies Used:

-antd: Version 5.9.4
-bootstrap: Version 5.3.2
-react-bootstrap: Version 2.9.0
-react-bootstrap-carousel: Version 4.1.1
-react-dom: Version 18.2.0
-react-responsive: Version 9.0.2
-react-scripts: Version 5.0.1
-react-scroll: Version 1.8.9
-sass: Version 1.68.0


What I Liked:
I thoroughly enjoyed the creative aspects of the project, particularly in terms of designing the layout and implementing the design. I made a conscious effort to rely more on React and its related dependencies, including React hooks, to craft dynamic and interactive components. The project was intentionally planned to minimize the use of Bootstrap and maximize the use of React's capabilities as it was instrumental in streamlining the development process, enhancing the project's functionality, and contributing to a seamless user experience. Additionally, I utilized plain CSS for styling, ensuring a polished and visually appealing presentation of the webpage.

What I Didnâ€™t Like:
During the development process, I encountered some tiny bugs with cross-browser compatibility, but nothing too scary. But, nevertheless, in the future, I would allocate additional time for thorough testing and debugging.

Issues Faced:
Cross-browser compatibility

3. Estimated Time to Complete the Test:
The estimated time to complete this project was 5 days with approximately 4 hours each day and that was mainly dealing with the positioning of each and every image and text. This includes planning, design, coding, debugging, testing, and deployment.

4. Known Issues and what I have planned to do:

- Instagram Button Disappearing on MacOS: There is a known issue where the Instagram button may disappear when hovering on MacOS.
- Limited Responsiveness: Currently, the webpage is not fully responsive and supports a minimum resolution of 1440x900. However, please note that improving responsiveness is on my development roadmap, and I intend to make the necessary adjustments to enhance the user experience on a variety of devices and screen sizes. I am ready to address this issue upon request if needed.
- Enhanced User Experience with React Bootstrap Pop-Up Windows: As part of the planned improvements, I also intend to implement pop-up windows using React Bootstrap for each button. This feature will provide a more interactive and user-friendly experience, enhancing the overall functionality and aesthetics of the webpage.

5. Enhancements and Modifications:

- Loading animation using React Hooks to let the user know the current state of the webpage
- Buttons Interaction: Buttons are now active both on hover and click, providing a more engaging and responsive user experience, and ofcourse they lead to a specific part of the page linked to that button.
- Social Media Icons: Social media icons react on hover, offering a visual response to user interactions.
- Text Animations: Specific text elements in the header and footer sections feature a subtle pulse animation on hover, adding a touch of interactivity and engagement.
- Biom Logo Interaction: The Biom logo responds with an animation on hover, creating a dynamic and playful element, althought can be improved.
- Header Follows Scrolling: The header now follows the user's scroll, ensuring it remains easily accessible as visitors navigate through the page.
- Instagram Section Scroll: The Instagram section is designed to move in response to scrolling, enhancing the visual flow and engagement on the page.
- Video Integration: Instead of hosting the video as an asset, a link is provided to display it. This approach optimizes loading speed for a smoother user experience.
- Image Interactivity: Images have been enhanced with hover interactions, making them more engaging and interactive.
- These enhancements not only improve the webpage's usability but also add a layer of interactivity and engagement to enhance the user experience.
